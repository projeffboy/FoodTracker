## Frontend (Mobile App)

Made with React Native Expo

Note: react-native-picker-select and @react-native-picker/picker depends on react 17 but we use react 18. It also required me to install react-native-gesture-handler and react-native-safe-area-context. As a result, you have to include this flag everytime in `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`

Retrieving the serving size for each food in a food list takes too long.

When deploying it on Expo EAS, make sure to provide the necessary secrets.
